T-Mart: Topography-adjusted Monte-carlo Adjacency-effect Radiative Transfer Code
================================================================================

This code can model the radiative transfer in a 3D atmosphere-ocean
system. It has three major components: atmosphere, water and land.

-  The atmosphere consists of layers with various scattering and
   absorbing properties.
-  Land is assumed to be Lambertian. The topography of land is modelled
   by triangulating the pixels in an input DEM.
-  Water has three reflectance properties: 1) water-leaving reflectance,
   2) white-caps and 3) surface reflectance (sky glint and sun glint). 1
   and 2 are assumed to be Lambertian, 3 is calculated through Cox&Munk
   slope statistics.

Input
-----

Essentials

-  Wavelength: wavelength in nm.
-  Surface:

   -  DEM: Digital Elevation Model, the elevation of pixels in this run.
   -  Cell size: the width and length of each pixel.
   -  Reflectance: reflectance of land or water-leaving reflectance of
      water, Lambertian.
   -  is_water: which pixels are water pixels.
   -  Background information: the elevation and reflectance of the
      background beyond the range of the pixels.

-  Atmosphere

   -  Atmosphere profile: choose from 6S.
   -  AOT550: aerosol optical thickness at 550nm.
   -  Aerosol_SPF: normalized aerosol scattering phase function.

-  n_photon: number of photons used in each run, default 1000. Recommend
   10,000 to 100,000.
-  Geometry: photon starting position, solar angle, viewing angle.

Optional

-  Aerosol scale height: default 2 km.
-  n_layers: number of atmospheric layers: default 10. Having more
   layers may slightly increase the computation time
-  Wind speed
-  Water salinity: in unit of parts per thousand, default 0.
-  Water temperature: in Celsius, default 25.
